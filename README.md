UDRS: Universal Data Representation System
This repository contains the source code for UDRS, a framework designed to represent and optimize data in systems with a potentially infinite number of dimensions. UDRS leverages concepts from swarm intelligence, gradient descent, and dimensionality reduction to facilitate collaborative exploration and optimization in high-dimensional spaces.

Key Features:

Universal Data Representation: UDRS supports diverse data types for dimensions, including numbers (whole and fractional), light spectrums, and even nested dimensions for hierarchical relationships.
Collaborative Learning with Pheromones: Inspired by ant foraging, UDRS allows dimensions to exchange information and influence each other's behavior through a pheromone-like mechanism.
Automatic Dimension Expansion: Based on user-defined criteria, UDRS can dynamically add new dimensions to the system as needed.
Selective Collaboration and Neighbor Discovery: Dimensions can identify relevant neighbors based on various criteria (e.g., name similarity, spatial proximity) and collaborate strategically with those neighbors.
Data Fusion Techniques: UDRS incorporates different data fusion techniques (e.g., averaging, weighted averaging) to effectively combine information from collaborating neighbors.
Cost Function Optimization: UDRS utilizes gradient descent to optimize individual dimension values or a combination of dimensions, minimizing a user-defined cost function.
Potential Applications:

High-dimensional data exploration and analysis
Modeling complex systems with emergent behavior
Collaborative problem solving and resource allocation
Machine learning with adaptive feature selection
Getting Started:

Clone this repository.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler that supports C++17 features (e.g., std::variant, std::unordered_map).
Refer to the main function in the source code for an example of how to use the UDRS class.
Code Structure:

FractionalDimension.h: Defines a class for representing fractional dimensions.
NestedDimension.h: Defines a class for representing nested dimensions with hierarchical relationships.
Dimension.h: Defines the core Dimension class, which represents a single dimension with a name, value, and collaboration logic.
UDRS.h: Defines the UDRS class, which manages a collection of dimensions and facilitates collaboration and optimization.
costFunction.h: Provides an example cost function for illustration purposes. (Replace this with your specific cost function.)
Further Considerations:

This is a conceptual framework, and some aspects like distance metrics and gradient calculations might need to be customized for specific applications.
The current implementation focuses on basic data types and collaboration mechanisms. It can be extended to support more complex data structures and advanced collaboration protocols.
We welcome contributions and suggestions for improvement!
